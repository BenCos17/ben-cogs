# How to Use Clusters


## Getting Started



### First Time Setup

1\. \*\*Load the cog\*\* in your Red-DiscordBot instance

[p]repo add ben-cogs https://github.com/bencos17/ben-cogs
[p]cog install ben-cogs clusters

### Basic Commands

- `[p]clusters` - main cluster info command
- `[p]renamecluster ` - allows the bot owner to override the default cluster names



\## Usage

\[p]clusters 
prints out the bots current clusters

for example this is my current output on my bot

\[p]renamecluster <shard\_id> <new\_name>





<shard\_id> is a number between 0 and your mac amount of shards

<new\_name> what you want the cluter to be called from now on

this is how it's used
