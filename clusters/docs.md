\[p]clusters 
for example this is my current output on my bot

<img width="506" height="516" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f44dd0d7-df98-410b-8b23-8a66f3d9cc7f" />

\[p]renamecluster <shard\_id> <new\_name>





<shard\_id> is a number between 0 and your mac amount of shards

<new\_name> what you want the cluter to be called from now on
