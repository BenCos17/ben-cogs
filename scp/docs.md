## Overview

## Commands

### Main Command Group
- **`[p]scp`**
  - Shows help or usage info for the SCP cog.

#### Subcommands

- **`[p]scp lookup <scp-number> [search-term]`**
  - Looks up a specific SCP by number (e.g., `scp-173`) and provides a summary. Optionally, search for a term within the article's description.
  - Example: `[p]scp lookup scp-173` or `[p]scp lookup scp-173 statue`

- **`[p]scp list [category]`**
  - Lists SCP articles, optionally filtered by category/tag (e.g., `safe`, `keter`).
  - Results are paginated with interactive buttons if there are many entries.
  - Example: `[p]scp list` or `[p]scp list safe`

- **`[p]scp random`**
  - Fetches a random SCP article and displays its summary.
  - Example: `[p]scp random`

- **`[p]scp info <scp-number>`**
  - Provides detailed information about a specific SCP, including the full article (split into pages if needed).
  - Example: `[p]scp info 173`

- **`[p]scp search <search-term>`**
  - Searches for SCP articles by name or content. This command may take longer as it scrapes the SCP Wiki.
  - Example: `[p]scp search lizard`

## Features & Notes
- **Pagination:** Long lists are split into multiple pages. Use the ‚¨ÖÔ∏è, ‚û°Ô∏è, and üõë buttons to navigate or cancel.
- **Embeds:** SCP lists are shown in rich embeds with links, author, rating, tags, and series.
- **Data Source:** Uses the [SCP Data API](https://scp-data.tedivm.com/data/scp/items/index.json) for fast lookups.
- **Limitations:**
  - Descriptions are not shown in lists due to API limitations.
  - Some commands (like `scp search`) may be slow or break if the SCP Wiki structure changes.
  - Only the user who invoked the command can control pagination.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Bot not responding?** Make sure the cog is loaded and you have the right permissions.
- **Pagination not working?** Ensure the bot has permission to use message components (buttons) and manage messages.
- **API errors?** The SCP Data API may be temporarily unavailable. Try again later.
- **Still having issues?** Check your bot logs for errors or ask for help (see below).
