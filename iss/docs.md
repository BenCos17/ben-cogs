\## 🚦 Understanding Sensor States



Because NASA uses \*\*MERGE\*\* mode for data transmission, sensors will show different states based on station activity:



\* \*\*🟢 Active (Green Circle)\*\*: Data has been received for this system within the last 60 seconds.

\* \*\*💤 Standby (Zzz Emoji)\*\*: The system is subscribed, but the value hasn't changed recently, so NASA isn't pushing updates.

\* \*\*🔹 Blue Diamond\*\*: Appears next to individual sensors that are currently streaming live data.

\* \*\*--- / Connecting\*\*: The bot is connected but waiting for the very first data packet to arrive for that specific ID.

\## 📂 Configuration (`telemetry.json`)



The Cog is entirely data-driven. To add or rename sensors, edit the `telemetry.json` file.



\*\*Format:\*\*

```json

"CATEGORY\_NAME": {

&nbsp;   "NASA\_OPCODE": "Display Label"

}
